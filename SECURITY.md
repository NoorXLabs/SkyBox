# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are prioritized for the latest stable release.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Latest release | Yes |
| Older releases | Best effort |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting:

- [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/NoorXLabs/SkyBox/security/advisories/new)

If that link is unavailable, report privately by email:

- [info@noorxlabs.com](mailto:info@noorxlabs.com?subject=SkyBox%20Security%20Vulnerability%20Report)

Include as much detail as possible:

- Affected version(s)
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

## Response Expectations

- Initial acknowledgment target: within 72 hours
- Triage/update target: within 7 days
- Fix timeline: depends on severity and release coordination

After validation, maintainers will coordinate remediation and release timing.
We will credit reporters who want public acknowledgment.

## Before stopping, consider updating CLAUDE.md

If you learned something useful during this session that would help future Claude sessions, run:

```
/claude-md-management:revise-claude-md
```

**Update CLAUDE.md when you encountered:**
- New bash commands or workflows
- Code patterns or conventions
- Environment/config quirks or gotchas
- Testing approaches that worked
- Architectural decisions

**Skip if:**
- Session was simple Q&A
- No new learnings about the codebase
- Changes were trivial or one-off

# Introduction

DevBox is a CLI tool for managing containerized development environments. It simplifies the process of creating, configuring, and sharing development setups using Docker containers.

## What is DevBox?

DevBox provides a streamlined workflow for:

- **Creating environments** - Initialize new development containers with sensible defaults
- **Managing lifecycle** - Start, stop, and monitor your development containers
- **Sharing configurations** - Clone and push environment configurations across teams

## Why DevBox?

Traditional development environment setup can be time-consuming and error-prone. DevBox solves this by:

1. **Consistency** - Everyone on your team uses the same environment
2. **Isolation** - Each project has its own container, avoiding dependency conflicts
3. **Reproducibility** - Environment configurations are version-controlled
